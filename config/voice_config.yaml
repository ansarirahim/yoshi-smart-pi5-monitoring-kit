voice:
  # Enable voice alerts
  enabled: true

  # Audio file path
  # Default: assets/are_you_ok.wav
  # Must be WAV format (PCM, 44100 Hz, 16-bit recommended)
  audio_file: "assets/are_you_ok.wav"

  # Playback volume (0.0 to 1.0)
  # 0.0 = mute, 1.0 = maximum volume
  # Recommended: 0.7 to 0.9 for indoor use
  volume: 0.8

  # Trigger Settings
  # Enable voice alert on fall detection
  trigger_on_fall: true

  # Enable voice alert on motion detection
  # Warning: May cause frequent alerts
  trigger_on_motion: false

  # Minimum interval between alerts (seconds)
  # Prevents alert spam
  # Set to 0 to disable rate limiting
  min_alert_interval: 30

  # Repeat Settings
  # Number of times to repeat alert
  # 1 = play once, 2 = play twice, etc.
  repeat_count: 1

  # Delay between repeats (seconds)
  repeat_delay: 2.0

  # Audio Device Settings (Linux/Raspberry Pi)
  # Leave empty for default audio device
  # Example: "hw:0,0" for specific ALSA device

  # Buffer size for audio playback
  # Larger buffer = less CPU usage but more latency
  # Smaller buffer = more CPU usage but less latency
  # Default: 4096 (good balance)

  # Logging
  log_playback: true
